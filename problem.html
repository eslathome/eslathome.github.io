      <h2>Stages of ESL Learning</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Silent Period:</strong> Learners absorb information.</li>
        <li><strong>Early Production:</strong> Learners begin to learn simple words and phrases.</li>
        <li><strong>Speech Emergence:</strong> Learners start using sentences, opinions, and questions.</li>
        <li><strong>Intermediate Fluency:</strong> Learners become more fluent and can express themselves better.</li>
      </ul>
